# What is R?

# What is R?

**R** is a programming language designed originally for *statistical analyses*.

--

**R** was created by **Ross Ihaka** and **Robert Gentleman** in 1993.

_(Their names are why it's called **R**, which is also a joke about the predecessor
being called **S**.)_

--

**R** was formally released by the **R Core Group** in 1997.

[https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html)


This group of 20-ish volunteers are the *only* people who can change the **base** 
(built-in) functionality of **R**.


---
# Strengths


**R**'s **strengths** are...

--

... handling data with lots of **different types** of variables.

--

... making nice and complex data **visualizations**.

--

... having cutting-edge statistical **methods** available to users.

---
# Weaknesses

**R**'s **weaknesses** are...

--

... performing non-analysis programming tasks, like website creation. 

(*python*, *ruby*, ...)


--

... hyper-efficient numerical computation. 

(*matlab*, *C*, ...)

--

... being a simple tool for all audiences 

(*SPSS*, *STATA*, *JMP*, *minitab*, ...)

# But wait!

![](appforthat.jpg)

---
# Packages

The heart and soul of **R** is **packages**.

--

These are "extra" sets of code that add **new functionality** to R when installed.

--

"Official" **R** packages live on the *Comprehensive R Archive 
Network*, or **CRAN**

--

But anyone can write and share new code in "package form" 

---

# Open-Source

Importantly, **R** is *open-source*.

--

There is no company that owns **R**, like there is for *SAS* or *Matlab*.

(*Python* is also open-source!)

--

This means nobody can sell their **R** code!

--

* (but you can sell "helpers" like **RStudio**)

--

* (and you can keep code **private** within an organization or company)

--

**Packages are created by users like you and me!**

# What is RStudio?

---
# What is RStudio?

**RStudio** is an IDE (*Integrated Developer Environment*).

This means it is an application that makes it easier for you to interact with **R**.

--

---
# History of RStudio

**RStudio** was released in 2011 by J.J. Allaire.

--

In 2014, RStudio hired *Hadley Wickham* as Chief Data Scientist.  They now employ around 20 full-time developers.

--

Recall: You can __not__ sell __R__ code; packages created by RStudio's team are freely available.  

They make money off the IDE and other helper software.

# Intro to R Markdown

---

# What is Markdown?

**Markdown** (without the "R") is a *markup language*.  This means special symbols and formatting to pretty documents.

--

Markdown files have the **.md** extension.

---

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/59f29676ef5e4d74685e14f801bbc10c2dbd3cef/c0688/lesson-images/markdown-1-markup.png)

---
# What is R Markdown?

**R Markdown** (with the "R") uses regular markdown, plus it can run and display **R** code.  (Other languages, too!)

--

R Markdown files have the **.Rmd** extension.

---

# Knitting

To convert your R Markdown file to a formatted document, click **Knit**.

![](https://rstudioblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/r-markdown-formats.png)
---
# Knitting

You do **not** have to knit a file to *save* it!!!

--

As you work, you should **save** extremely frequently and **knit** semi-regularly.

--

When you click **knit**, here is what happens:


- Your file is saved.

- The R code written in your *.Rmd* file gets run.

    + Any code you ran already doesn't "count"; we start from scratch.
    + The code is run *in order*.


- A new file is created.

    + If your R Markdown file is called "Data_Analysis.Rmd", then a file called "Data_Analysis.html" will be created in the same directory as the Rmd.

# Setup Steps

- In the frontmatter, choose a good title.

- Save your `.Rmd` file, and name it something meaningful (match the title!)

--

- Your first code chunk looks like this:

````
```{r setup, include=FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
````

--

- Your second code chunk looks like this:

````
```{r libraries}`r ''`
library(tidyverse)
```
````

---

## Good organization

- Use `#` to make section headings etc.

- Each code chunk is a unified thought.

- Text before and after each code chunk to motivate your code and explain the output.

- Make deliberate decisions about what to display:
    + Does the reader need to see data loading step?
    + Does the reader need to see your code?
    + Does the reader need to see the output?
    

---

## Naming code chunks

- Notice that code chunks can have labels:

````
```{r data}`r ''`
my_data <- read_csv("penguins.csv")
```
````

--

- Lets you jump between chunks

--

- Careful with copy-pasting, duplicate names are not allowed.


---
## Setting chunk options

- `echo`: Should this code be **shown** (echoed)?

- `eval`: Should this code be **run** (evaluated)?

- `include`: Should this code be neither shown nor run?

- `error`: If there is an error, should that display rather than breaking the knit?

- `warning`: If there is a warning, should that display?

- `message`: If there is a message, should that display?

---
## Setting options for ALL chunks

Recall that first setup chunk.

What do you think this does?

````
```{r global_options, eval=FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=6, fig.height=4,
                      echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, 
                      message=FALSE, eval=TRUE)
```
````

--

- (you can always override these for individual chunks)

--

* External packages that add more themes: `prettydoc`, `rmdformats`, etc.

* Nest "child" documents in the parent, for easier file organization.

(https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/child-document.html)

--

* *Parametrized* reports: values established in the header fill in the rest of the document.  

(https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/parameterized-reports.html)

--

* Auto-generation of reports with `plumber`, Docker, and/or RStudio Connect

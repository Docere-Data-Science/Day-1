# The tidyverse

* One philosophy of the **tidyverse** is building **pipe-friendly** functions.

* Another philosophy is using **English verbs** as function names instead of symbols or abbreviations.

* Some consider this more accessible/readable

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}

penguins[penguins$species == "Adelie",]
```


---
# The tidyverse

**Pros:**

* Fairly consistent behavior of functions

    + Predictable **input** and **output** types
    + *"opinionated"*
    + More on this later
    
--

* Semi-guaranteed maintenance of packages

(because RStudio pays developers!)

--

* More available and polished documentation and tutorials

--

* Welcoming community

---
# The tidyverse

**Cons:**

* Sometimes less flexible for complex tasks

--

* Generally slower, especially on big data

--

* Updates frequently -> sometimes this makes your old code unrunnable.

--

* Some people object to **RStudio**'s strong influence over an open-source community.

# Should you use the tidyverse???

--

Even the most die-hard tidyverse fanatics use base R and other packages quite frequently.

--

Above all, the best code approach is the one that

- you enjoy the most 

- gets job done

- lets you collaborate with colleagues.

# The Pipe

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('penguins %>% summary()', eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair("%>%") %>% 
  flair_funs(color = "teal")
```

is the same as

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('summary(penguins)', eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_funs(color = "teal")
```

---
# The Pipe

What do you think the following will do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---
# The Pipe

What do you think the following will do?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```


---

# Summarizing

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  summary()
  ') %>% flair("y(")
```

---
# Cleaning 1: missing data

Oh no!  There was one row of the dataset with missing values.

--

There is no magic answer for how to handle missing values; one solution is to simply drop them from the data.

*Consider - why might this sometimes be a bad idea?*

--

```{r}
penguins <- 
  penguins %>%
  drop_na()

penguins %>% summary()
  
```

---
# Cleaning 2: What's in a name?

The column names in the `penguins` dataset are nice for a few reasons:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
names(penguins)
```

* No capital letters

* Underscores to separate words

* Short but descriptive


--

What if they weren't?

---
# Cleaning 2: What's in a name?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
names(iris)
```
--

The `janitor` package!

```{r}
library(janitor)

iris %>%
  clean_names
```



---
# Summarizing specific variables

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  summarize(mean_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
  ') %>% 
  flair("ize(") %>% 
  flair("mean", color = "teal") %>%
  flair("body_mass_g", color = "cornflowerblue")
```

--

* What are the **required** arguments of `summarize`?  

* Are there any optional arguments?

---

# Many variables?  Many summary statistics?
## No problemo

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  summarize(across(c(body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm),
            list(mean, median)))
  ') %>% 
  flair("across") %>%
  flair_rx("(mean)|(median)", color = "teal") %>%
  flair_rx("(body_mass_g)|(flipper_length_mm)", color = "cornflowerblue") %>%
  flair_rx("list", color = "darkred")
```

---
# Making new variables

Verb: `mutate()`

The dataset gets *mutated* to include a new variable.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  mutate(
    bill_size = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm
  ) %>%
  summary()
  ') %>%
  flair("mutate") %>%
  flair("bill_size", color = "teal")
```

---

Cool, let's look at our new variable!

```{r, error = TRUE}
penguins %>%
  summarize(mean_bill = sd(bill_size))
```

--

OH NO!

**What happened here?**

---

class: center, middle

# We calculated a new variable, but didn't reassign the data object

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins <- penguins %>%
          mutate(
            bill_size = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm
          )
          
penguins %>%
  summarize(mean_bill = sd(bill_size))
') %>% 
  flair("penguins <- ")


```

---
# Ordering

Verb: `arrange()`

We **arrange** the dataset in order of a particular variable.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---

## Related: `top_n`

```{r}
penguins %>%
  top_n(3, body_mass_g)
```

---

# Quick check in!

Remember,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  top_n(3, body_mass_g)
```

is the same as

```{r, eval = FALSE}
top_n(penguins, 3, body_mass_g)
```

or

```{r, eval = FALSE}
top_n(x = penguins, n = 3, wt = body_mass_g)
```

---

# Selecting

Verb: `select()`

We **select** which variables we would like to remain in the dataset.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(species, body_mass_g) %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---

# Filtering

Verb: `filter()`

We **filter** to the rows (observations) we would like to keep in the dataset.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins_new %>%
  select(species, body_mass_g) %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---

# Grouping and summarizing

---
# `group_by`

* We have learned how to use the `summarize` functions to get information.

* What if you want to summarize your data within categories?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(mean(body_mass_g))

```
---
# Warning!

## You should **always** have a `summarize` after a `group_by`!!!

(There are other ways to use it, but wait until you are very familiar with `dplyr` to try that.)

---

## Try it together on the `iris` dataset

* What is the average Petal Length for the versicolor irises?

* What is the greatest sepal Length for each of the three species of iris in this dataset?

* If we define Petal Area as Petal Length times Petal Width, then what are the top three Petal Areas for each species?

* Try to do each of these in a single chain of pipes!

# Tidy Data for Joining and Pivoting Data

---
## Tidy Data Principles

1. Every **variable** is a **column**.

--

2. Every **observation** (or **sample**) is a **row**.

--

3. Every **value** is in a **cell**

---
class: center, middle

![](tidy_data.png)

---
## Tidy Data

Questions to Ponder:

--

What are the **observational units** in the dataset?

--

* In a database of customer demographic info, perhaps it is the *customers*

--

* In a database of transactions, perhaps it is *unique transaction*, i.e, unique combos of *customer* and *date*

--

What are the **variables** we want to study?

--

* Should we have one *numeric* column called `Customer Balance 2020` and one *numeric* column called `Customer Balance 2021`?

--

* Or should we have one *numeric* column called `Customer Balance` and one *categorical* column called `Date`?

---
## Example

Consider the following dataset containing health information of cereals:

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = F, message = F}
cereals <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/ll2c9drmlom1ony/cereals.csv?dl=1") %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~na_if(.x, -1))
head(cereals)
```


---

## Example

Consider the research question:  *How do the sugar and protein contents compare across cereal manufacturers?*

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cereals %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sugars, y = protein, color = mfr)) +
  geom_point()
```

---


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = F, message = F}
cereals %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sugars, y = protein, color = mfr)) +
  geom_point()
```

---
## Example


```{r}
avg_by_mfr <- cereals %>%
  group_by(mfr) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_sugars = mean(sugars),
    mean_protein = mean(protein)
  )

avg_by_mfr
```

---


.pull-left[
```{r, warning = F}
avg_by_mfr %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mfr, y = mean_sugars)) +
  geom_col()
```
]

.pull-left[
```{r, warning = F}
avg_by_mfr %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mfr, y = mean_protein)) +
  geom_col()
```
]

---
## Example

Why are we stuck?

--

Let's return to the **research question**:  How do the nutrient levels (sugar/protein) vary across manufacturers?

--

This question involves **three variables**:

* `manufacturer` - categorical

* `nutrient level`, how many grams of the nutrient in question are present - quantitative

* `nutrient type`, which nutrient we measured - categorical

--

Our data is not **tidy** with respect to this question!

---

# Pivoting Longer

---
## Pivoting Longer

Right now, our cereal data is **wide**: each nutrient is its own column

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(cereals)
```


---
## Pivoting

Our goal is to make it **long**: One column for all values, one column for nutrient type labels.

--

`pivot_longer()` function need to know:

* Which columns are involved in the pivoting

* What you will name the new **values** variable

* What you will name the new **labels** variable

---

## Pivoting

```{r}
cereals_longer <- cereals %>%
  select(name, mfr, protein, sugars) %>%
  pivot_longer(protein:sugars,
               names_to = "Nutrient",
               values_to = "Amount")

cereals_longer
```

---

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cereals_longer %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mfr, y = Amount, fill = Nutrient)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = F}
cereals_longer %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mfr, y = Amount, fill = Nutrient)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cereals_longer %>%
  group_by(mfr, Nutrient) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_amount = mean(Amount)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mfr, y = avg_amount, fill = Nutrient)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = F, message = F}
cereals_longer %>%
  group_by(mfr, Nutrient) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_amount = mean(Amount)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mfr, y = avg_amount, fill = Nutrient)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

# Pivoting Wider

---
## Example

Let's now return to the `penguins` dataset:

```{r}
head(penguins)
```

---
## Example

Suppose we want to ask the question,

> How much do female and male bill lengths differ, on average, by species?

--

```{r, message = F}
avg_bills <- penguins %>%
  group_by(species, sex) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_bill = mean(bill_length_mm)
  ) 

avg_bills

```

---
## Example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
avg_bills %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  mutate(
    ??????? - ?????
  )

```

---
## Example

What went wrong?

--

We wanted to subtract the variable `avg_bill_female` from the variable `avg_bill_male`.

--

But these are not variables!!!

--

Our data is not **tidy** with respect to our research question.

---
## Example

```{r}
avg_bills_wider <- avg_bills %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex,
              values_from = avg_bill)

avg_bills_wider
```

---
## Example

```{r}
avg_bills_wider <- avg_bills %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex,
              values_from = avg_bill,
              names_prefix = "avg_bill_")

avg_bills_wider
```

---
## Example

```{r}
avg_bills_wider %>%
  mutate(
    bill_diff  = avg_bill_male - avg_bill_female
  ) %>%
  arrange(bill_diff)
```

## Joining Datasets

---



## Left Join (and Right Join)

A **left join** prioritizes the **first** dataset.

--

We use it when we are trying to add information from Dataset B into Dataset A,
without changing the structure of Dataset A.

--

`left_join()` in `dplyr`

--

A **right join** is the same thing, but prioritizing the **second** dataset.

---

![](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/left-join.gif)
---

![](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/left-join-extra.gif)

---

## Full Join

A **full join** retains **all information** in **either dataset**.

--

`full_join()` in `dplyr`

--

It is used when you have data from two sources, and you want to combine them into one dataset.

--

Note:  Missing information becomes "NA"!


---

![](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/full-join.gif)

---

## Inner Join

An **inner join** retains only information for the observations that appear in **both datasets**.

--

`inner_join()` in `dplyr`

--

Careful!  If your subject isn't in **both** Dataset A and Dataset B, the info will be lost!

--

This is used to create a dataset with *no missing information*

---

![](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/inner-join.gif)

---

## Semi Join

An **semi join** is the same as an inner join, but it does not keep the variables from the second dataset.

--

`semi_join()` in `dplyr`

--

Dataset B is being used to reduce Dataset A, but none of its other information is retained.

---

![](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/semi-join.gif)

---

## Anti Join

An **anti join** retains only information that appears in **one, but not both** of the datasets.

--

`anti_join()` in `dplyr`

--

It is rarely practical as a data creation.

--

Instead, we use it as a shortcut to answer questions about which observations are not in both datasets.

--

It is rarely important to make the distinction between integers and doubles.

---
# Data Types: Boolean

For Boolean data , you should think of the data as having values `0` (`FALSE`) or `1` (`TRUE`).

```{r}

# Object Structures

Is your object a...

* function?

* vector?

* list?

* data frame?

* matrix?

---
# Vectors

A **vector** is a set of values that are all the same **type**

```{r, error  = TRUE}
my_vec <- c("a", "b", "c")

str(my_vec)

my_vec <- c(1, 3, 5)

str(my_vec)

my_vec <- c(1, "a")

str(my_vec)

---
# Vectors

A vector with only one **element** is called an **atomic vector**.

```{r, error  = TRUE}

my_vec <- 1

str(my_vec)

my_vec[1]

```

---

# Matrices

A **matrix** is a **two-dimensional** set of values that are all the same type.



```{r, error  = TRUE}
my_mat <- matrix(c("a", "b", "c", "d"), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

str(my_mat)
```

--
Note: If turning  vector into a matrix, be careful with rows and columns!

```{r}
my_mat
```


---
# Lists

A **list** is the the **most general** object.  Any structure and any data type can be stored in a list!

```{r}
my_list <- list(
  a = "Well hi there",
  b = 1:10,
  c = my_mat

# Errors, warnings, and messages

---
# Messages

Just because you see scary red text, this does **not** mean something went wrong!  

This is just **R** communicating with you.

--

For example, you often see a lot of messages after:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

---
# Warnings

Often, **R** will give you a **warning**.

--

This means that your code *did* run...

--

...but you probably want to make sure it succeeded.

---
# Warnings


```{r}
my_vec <- c("a", "b", "c")

my_new_vec <- as.integer(my_vec)
```

--

```{r}
my_new_vec
```

---
# Errors

If the word **Error** appears in your message from **R**, then you have a problem.

--

This means your code **could not run**!

--

```{r, error = TRUE}
my_vec <- c("a", "b", "c")

my_new_vec <- my_vec + 1
```
---
class: center, middle

## Parlez-vous ERROR?

Error messages can be confusing!

---
# Translations

**R** says...

> Error: Object 'some_obj' not found.

It *probably* means...

> You haven't run the code to create 'some_obj'  OR you have a typo in the name!

--

```{r, error = TRUE}
some_ojb <- 1:10

mean(some_obj)
```

---
# Translations

**R** says...

> Error: Object of type 'closure' is not subsettable.

It *probably* means...

> Oops, you tried to use square brackets on a function

--

```{r, error = TRUE}
mean[1,2]
```

---
# Translations

**R** says...

> Error: Non-numeric argument to binary operator

It *probably* means...

> You tried to do math on data that isn't numeric.

--

```{r, error = TRUE}
"a" + 2
```

---
# Okay, now what?

When all else fails, **Google** your error message.

--

* Leave out the specifics.

--

* Include the function you are using.

# Try it...

*What's wrong here?*

```{r, error = TRUE}
